# Credit Card Default Prediction: Feature Selection Techniques

**Enhancing Predictive Accuracy with Strategic Feature Selection**

This project is dedicated to the exploration of feature selection methodologies, specifically Forward Selection and Backward Elimination, applied to a dataset focused on credit card default predictions. By discerning and eliminating non-essential features, the project aims to refine the predictive model's performance and efficiency. Enclosed within this repository is a detailed Python script guiding through the application of these feature selection techniques on the dataset.

**Dataset Insights**
The dataset encompasses a range of variables related to credit card clients, including demographic information, credit details, payment histories, and the pivotal target variable - the likelihood of a client defaulting on the payment in the following month.

**Feature Selection Strategies**
- **Forward Selection**: Initiates with an empty model, progressively incorporating variables that exhibit statistical significance.
- **Backward Elimination**: Commences with a full model, systematically excluding variables lacking statistical significance.

**Getting Started**
1. Download the Python script from the repository.
2. Modify the dataset path in the script to correspond with its location on your device.
3. Execute the script to unveil the outcomes of employing both feature selection strategies.

**Prerequisites**
- Python 3
- Libraries: Pandas, Scikit-learn

**Acknowledgment**
The project utilizes the "Default of Credit Card Clients" dataset available at [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/default+of+credit+card+clients).

By implementing these feature selection techniques, this project illuminates the path towards more streamlined and effective predictive modeling, paving the way for enhanced decision-making processes in credit risk management.
